# Programming-and-Problem-Solving-I
COURSE OUTLINE
Course Name:	Programming and Problem Solving I

COURSE DESCRIPTION

This subject is a required subject in the basic knowledge block of the Bachelor of Software Engineering and Bachelor of Computer Networks and Data Communications training programs.

This course equips students with the basic principles of computer programming and solving real-world problems. Students have the opportunity to apply knowledge of structured programming, programming language syntax, control structures, methods, arrays, and string processing techniques to scientific, engineering, and real-world problems.

This course is the prerequisite course of the course Programming and Problem Solving II (CSE 104)

COURSE OBJECTIVES

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

  Apply programming knowledge and have the skills to use a programming language to illustrate and solve simple problems in study and real-life.
